## Hi there üëãüèæ, I'm Kristen üòÅ
Welcome to my page! I transitioned from someone who worked many different types of jobs (worked customer service for 20+ years, worked in hospitality for 10+ years, and worked as a logistics broker to name a few titles) into software engineering after doing a ton of reasearch and ultimately falling in love with coding while researching and working through free course work. Thanks to App Academy (where I recently graduated üéâ) I was able to make that dream in pursuing this new career path a reality. Really enjoy seeing projects I work on come to life from start to finish as well as really enjoy working with a team of engineers in building applications, learning from each other and bouncing ideas off of one another.
